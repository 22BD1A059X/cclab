Lambda:
function -> create function -> RUntime env(Python 3.9) -> Architecture 86_64 -> Role -> existing(labrole) ->create
then select function -> actions -> view details -> configuration -> function url -> auth type ->AWS_IAM save
to test we need event
event -> test -> name -> private save
paste the code
Bucket -> create bucket -> block all public access
DynamoDB -> create Table -> new table -> partition key (unique)
in lambda add trigger -> config ->s3 -> bucket(our bucket) -> event types(include all) save 
now if you add anything in the bucket it will show in dynamodb table
in the lambda code we have to change the name of the table or we have to change the name in code
